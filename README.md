- Data Collection and Cleansing:
  - Employee data was collected, including demographics, job roles, salaries, and years at the company. The data was then cleaned and preprocessed for consistency and accuracy.
- Visualization:
  - Each KPI was visualized using charts like bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to present insights clearly.
- Analysis:
  - Trends were identified, such as high attrition among younger employees and those in lower salary slabs.

## Conclusion:
The dashboard reveals significant insights into attrition patterns:

- Young and Low Salary Employees:
   - Employees in the 26-35 age range and those in lower salary brackets show higher attrition, indicating that younger employees or those with limited income may feel less engaged or seek better opportunities.
- High Attrition in Specific Roles:
   - Job roles like Laboratory Technician and Human Resources have higher attrition rates, suggesting these positions may need more attention to improve employee retention.
- Early Attrition:
   - A noticeable trend is a high attrition rate within the first year, suggesting that onboarding and early engagement efforts might be areas for improvement.

These insights can guide HR strategies to improve employee retention, particularly in the areas of compensation, role-specific engagement, and onboarding processes.
